    p <b>Bagadonuts Gear</b> is my line of homemade gear. I started making gear when I had to cancel my Appalachian Trail in early 2020. Since then it's become a challening and very rewarding hobby. Being able to survive in the wilderness thanks to my own clothes and gear instills an immense amount of confidence.

    p So far I have made:
    ul
        li 2 backpacks (RayWay, BagBuff) 
        li Shorts, pants, 2 jackets (RayWay, Green Pepper) 
        li Mittens
        li Flat tarp
        li Bug bivy
        li Mesh tent with bathtub floor 
        li Stuff sacks
        li Bottle and pot insulators 
        li Bicycle frame bag

    each item in gear
        h1 #{item.name}
        p Materials: 
        ul
            each mat in item.materials
                li #{mat}
