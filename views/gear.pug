      <b>Bagadonuts Gear</b> is my line of homemade backpacking gear. I started making my own gear in early 2020, when I had to cancel my Appalachian Trail attempt due to Covid.<br>
      Since then, it's become a challenging and rewarding hobby; being able to survive in the wilderness, thanks to my own shelter, clothes, and other gear, instills an immense amount of confidence.
