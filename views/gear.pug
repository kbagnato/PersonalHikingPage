  p.text-center.
    <b>Bagadonuts Gear</b> is my line of homemade backpacking gear. I started making my own gear in early 2020, when I had to cancel my Appalachian Trail attempt due to Covid.<br>
    Since then, it's become a challenging and rewarding hobby; being able to survive in the wilderness, thanks to my own clothes, shelter, and gear, instills an immense amount of confidence.


  

  p So far I have made:
  ul
    li 2 backpacks (RayWay, BagBuff)

    li Mittens
    li Flat tarp
    li Bug bivy
    li Mesh tent with bathtub floor 
    li Stuff sacks
    li Bottle and pot insulators
